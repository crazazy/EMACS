#+title: Crazazy's EMACS distribution
#+author: Crazazy

This Emacs distribution is made in such a way that it can also be installed via nix

unlike [[https://github.com/matthewbauer/bauer][BAUER]], this distribution mostly focuses on programming and is not made using org mode.
Instead it's made by concatenating elisp files, which can be done because all packages are installed using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and thus should be position-independent

You can install this distribution using [[https://nixos.org/download.html][nix]] like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-env -if https://github.com/crazazy/EMACS/archive/master.tar.gz -A
#+END_SRC
